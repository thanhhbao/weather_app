## API Key Setup

This app requires an API key from a weather data provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). To make the app functional, you'll need to obtain your own key and integrate it into the project. Typically, you'd place this key in a specific file (like a `.env` file or a `constants.dart` file) within the project's root or `lib` folder. Please refer to the project's specific instructions for exact placement.
